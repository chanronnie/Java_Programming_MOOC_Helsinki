## Exercise 9: Asteroids

### About this exercise
The goal of this exercise is to build a larger application by following the course examples step by step. 
The game created in this exercise is a simplified simulation of the Asteroid game. 
It contains three main characters:
- a ship (that shoots projectiles)
- multiple projectiles 
- multiple asteroids that float and move randomly in the space.
