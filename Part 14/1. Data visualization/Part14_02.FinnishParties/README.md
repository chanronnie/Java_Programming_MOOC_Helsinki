### About this exercise
The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the pre-built Java libraries for creating visualization by recreating the line chart as directed by the instruction.
The above chart is my attempt.

### Approach
1. Read the provided dataset file using Java code.
2. Extract the data from the dataset into a `HashMap`.
3. Create the chart by iterating over the `HashMap` with the help of the stream concept.

### Files Content
* [PartiesApplication.java](PartiesApplication.java): This file contains the Java code for creating the visualization.
* [partiesdata.tsv](partiesdata.tsv): This file contains the dataset used for the line chart.
* [LineChart_FinnishParties.png](LineChart_FinnishParties.png): This image shows the resulting line chart.
